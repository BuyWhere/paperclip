User archetype: ${archetypeName} (${archetype})

User goals:
${goalsText}

Generate 2-3 projects per goal that are ADAPTIVE to this specific person's archetype and goals. Not generic templates.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of projects with this exact shape:
[
  {
    "id": "unique-id",
    "name": "Project name",
    "description": "2-sentence description specific to this goal",
    "estimatedDuration": "e.g. 3 months",
    "suggestedOrder": 1,
    "domainId": "career|wealth|health|relationships|learning|legacy",
    "goalName": "the goal this belongs to",
    "accepted": true
  }
]

Rules:
- Projects must be actionable and specific to the goal, not generic
- suggestedOrder should reflect logical sequencing within each goal's projects
- Match the archetype's energy: ${archetype === 'command_center' ? 'systematic, bold, efficiency-driven' : archetype === 'organic_garden' ? 'sustainable, holistic, growth-focused' : 'structured but warm'}
- Return 8-15 projects total across all goals`
